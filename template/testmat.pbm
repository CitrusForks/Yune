# Template for material file required by Yune.
# "ks" can also be thought of as the fresnel reflectance  at normal incidence. "kd" is the color due to diffuse reflection
# and should be near 0 for metals. "alpha_x" and "alpha_y" are parameters that control slope distribution of microfacets for anisotropic
# materials. They are equal for isotropic materials. "mirror" and "transmissive" determine whether the material is perfectly
# specular and transparent.
# If you are interested in the datatype Yune loads these values into, refer to the header "CL_headers.h"
