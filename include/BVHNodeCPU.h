 *  "Yune" is a personal project and an educational raytracer/pathtracer. It's aimed at young
 *  researchers trying to implement raytracing/pathtracing but don't want to mess with boilerplate code.
 *  It provides all basic functionality to open a window, save images, etc. Since it's GPU based, you only need to modify
 *  the kernel file and see your program in action. For details, check <https://github.com/gallickgunner/Yune>
